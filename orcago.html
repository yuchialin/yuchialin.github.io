                <p>Before diving into the design, I visited 2 workshops which were hosted by different enterprises and different lecturers to observe how the users completed the tasks in their natural working environment.

                <h3>IT TAKES TIME TO PREPARE THE SIGN-IN SHEET AND IT'S EASY TO MESS THEM UP</h3>
                <div class="q">“I usually have 3 classes or workshops in a day and they are all in different locations. It’s really easy to mess up the sign-in sheets of different workshops.”</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>In average, lecturers have more than 1 class at different locations in a day. The schedules were back-to-back, so the lecturers did not have time to print them out before the workshops. They had to finish all the preparation work a day before and carry the sign-in sheets for all the workshop. Yet, it was easy to mess up the sign-in sheets since they did not know the attendees.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>WORKSHOP CANNOT START ON TIME BECAUSE OF THE SIGN-IN PROCESS</h3>
                <div class="q">“It’s always a mess at the beginning of the workshop. People usually rush into the classroom at the last minute and we will need to wait for 10 minutes just to let people sign-in and take the seats”</div>
                <ul>
                        <li>Most employees arrived at the classroom 5 minutes before the workshop starts. Some even arrived late and looked for the sign-in sheet after the lecturer starts. The workshop would not start on time since the lecturer preferred to start the workshop after all the employees in line signed up and take seats.
                </ul>
                <h3>HARD TO KEEP TRACK OF WHETHER STUDENTS STAY FOR THE ENTIRE WORK SHOP</h3>
                <div class="q">“People would leave the workshop earlier. I hope there’s a way to keep track of that since we need to report this information to their boss”</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some employees would leave the classroom in the middle of the workshop, but the lecturers have no way to keep track. It is hard to ask students to sign again after the workshop, since people usually just rush out from the classroom. Yet it is critical to know this information because the employees are being paid by the company for their time in the workshop.

                <p>Given the amount of work that George has to do before the workshop starts, the setting process should be simple and fast. With only few clicks, George is able to set up the sign-in feature.</p>
